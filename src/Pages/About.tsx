      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Situation</h3>
      <p>
        I am currently working part-time as a <span>Driver</span> &{" "}
        <span>Warehouse</span> Operative, whilst also studying to be a{" "}
        <span>Web-Developer</span>. I have been studying web development for the
        past 2 1/2 years, using <span>JavaScript</span> libraries and
        frameworks.
        <br />
        <br />
        My short-term objective is to obtain a position within the tech
        industry, as a <span>Web-Developer</span> or similar, in order to build
        working knowledge within web/app environments and developing
        transferable skills/experience within those fields.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the long-term I wish to learn a high-level language such as{" "}
        <span>C++</span>, <span>C# </span>
        and/or <span>Python</span> to understand knowledge about automation
        through the use of machine-learning and artificial intelligences,
        applying ease-of-use automation in order to reduce repetitive every-day
        tasks & interactions.
      </p>

      <h3>Knowledge</h3>
      <p>
        I'm highly competent in <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span>,{" "}
        <span>JavaScript</span>/<span>TypeScript</span>. I use{" "}
        <span>React</span>, setup with <span>Vite</span> for quick front-end{" "}
        <span>TypeScript</span> projects. I prefer to use <span>Vite</span> to
        setup my <span>React</span> environment as <span>Vite</span> has
        front-end tooling and has out-of-the-box support for{" "}
        <span>TypeScript</span>, <span>JSX</span>, <span>CSS</span>, etc...
        <br />
        <br />
        For REST APIs I use <span>Node.js</span> with the{" "}
        <span>Express.js</span> framework. I prefer <span>Express.js</span> as
        it is a fast, unopinionated and minimalist framework that I use to
        create APIs quickly and efficiently.
        <br />
        <br />
        For E-Commerce and other Full-Stack apps I prefer to use{" "}
        <span>Next.js</span> with <span>Stripe</span>. I enjoy using{" "}
        <span>Next.js</span> as it is a framework of <span>React.js</span>,
        using its server and client components streamlines the process of
        building a full-stack web-app.
        <br />I use <span>Tailwind</span> & <span>ShadCn</span> component
        library for styling my small projects and <span>SASS</span> for larger
        projects that require more advanced <span>CSS</span> setup.
        <br />
        <br />
        With state management for small projects I use <span>React</span>{" "}
        useReducer to pass data to useContext, in which data is passed to and
        from components through the use of a context provider. For larger
        projects I use <span>Redux</span> tool kit, as it provides a simple and
        efficient way to implement handling of more complex state changes.
        <br />
        For encryption I use <span>B-Crypt</span> and for
        authorization/authentication I like to use <span>Auth0</span>, with its
        easy-to-use APIs.
