# Portfolio Project

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a personal Portfolio website that contains a list of my Projects & Challenges.

## Process

I will be using React with TypeScript & Vite.

The Vite template provides a minimal setup to get React working within Vite with Hot Module Replacement and some ESLint rules.
